# WaferFaultPrediction


## Technical Aspect:
   This project is divided into two part:
   1. Training
       -  Validating all raw data file according to schema file(Have all the information about Good Raw Data).
       -  Storing good raw data to a SQLite3 data base.
       -  Imporing the data from SQLite3 data base to local in form of csv.
       -  Dividing the data into clusters using KMean Clusterig and train clusters with best Machine learning models using Sklearn and XGBoost API.
       -  Building a Flask web app.
   2. Prediction
       -  Validating all raw data file according to schema file(Have all the information about Good Raw Data).
       -  Storing good raw data to a SQLite3 data base.
       -  Imporing the data from SQLite3 data base to local in form of csv.
       -  Dividing the data into clusters using KMean Clusterig and predict these clusters with best Machine learning models.
